# DCUCloudTechologyAssignment3
Assignment source code for cloud technology coursework at Dublin City University. This focuses on understanding big data technologies like apache hadoop.

##Motivation and introduction
The primary requirements are to use a cloud data processing technology for ETL(Extract, Transform and Load) Big Data and create either a Web or Mobile UI with it; this coursework is using Apache Hadoop and D3.js for these purposes. Essentially, AWS is a cloud service providing suite of services like storage with S3, map-reduce processing with EMR, querying with Hive on top of Apache Hadoop.

D3.js is ideal as a webfrontend as it runs on Node.js server to visualise big data.
